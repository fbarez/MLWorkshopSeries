    "In many settings we have to make decisions under uncertainty. One way to quantify the uncertainty is to model using probability theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two reasons why we might want to model under uncertainty:\n",
    "1. laziness (modeling every detail of a complex system is costly)\n",

    "Probability is the branch of mathematics that studies the possible outcomes of given events together with the outcomes' relative likelihoods and distributions. In common usage, the word \"probability\" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. The analysis of events governed by probability is called statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several competing interpretations of the actual \"meaning\" of probabilities. Frequentists view probability simply as a measure of the frequency of outcomes (the more conventional interpretation), while Bayesians treat probability more subjectively as a statistical procedure that endeavors to estimate parameters of an underlying distribution based on the observed distribution.\n",
