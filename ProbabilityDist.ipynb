So the random variable $X$ which has a Bernoulli distribution can take value $1$ with the probability of $success$, say $p$, and the value $0$ with the probability of $failure$, say q or $1-p$.\n",

The distribution has two parameters: the number  n of repetitions of the experiment and the probability  p of success of an individual experiment.\n",
